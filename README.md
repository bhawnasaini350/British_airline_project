# British Airways Review Analysis & Prediction ✈️

## Overview
This project analyzes British Airways customer reviews and builds predictive models to classify customer booking behavior. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning models to predict booking completion.

## Features 🌟
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** ✅
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔬
- **Customer Sentiment Analysis** 📊
- **Predictive Modeling (Machine Learning)** 🤖

---

## Data Sources
The project uses the following datasets:
1. **British Airways Reviews**: Customer feedback on aspects like seat comfort, food, and overall experience.
2. **Customer Booking Data**: Details about flight bookings, sales channels, and travel patterns.

---

## Technologies Used ⚙️
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Scikit-Learn, RandomForest, SVM, Gradient Boosting)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Squarify)
- **Data Preprocessing** (Ordinal Encoding, Feature Scaling)

---

## Data Cleaning 🌍
- **Handled Missing Values**: Filled NaN values with appropriate defaults.
- **Converted Data Types**: Changed data types for numerical and categorical values.
- **Text Processing**: Cleaned customer reviews by removing unwanted characters.
- **Feature Engineering**: Mapped categorical values to numerical formats.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
- **Visualized Seat Comfort & Rating Distribution**
- **Analyzed Customer Preferences**
- **Examined Correlations Between Features**
- **Identified Key Factors Influencing Ratings**

---

## Predictive Modeling 🤖
We implemented multiple machine learning models to predict customer booking behavior:

### ✅ **Models Used & Performance**
| Model | Accuracy |
|--------|------------|
| Random Forest | High 🔺 |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | Moderate 📉 |
| Logistic Regression | Moderate 📉 |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | High 🔺 |
| Gradient Boosting | Very High ⭐️ |

---

## Results & Insights 🔎
- **Business Class received better ratings** compared to Economy.
- **Seat Comfort and Food & Beverages** were key factors affecting overall ratings.
- **Gradient Boosting performed best** for booking prediction.
- **Customers preferred specific travel routes**, affecting booking completion rates.
